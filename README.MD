# Todo List

This is just a simple app, every js programer has.
Check [result](https://k372470.github.io/TodoList/) out by yourself.

## How to use

There are two standart options to start the project: 
* Start web server from `src/` folder
* open `index.html` file

## Configure the project

I'm using [prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatter for better read-ability of code.
To change any of it parameters use `.prettierrc` file and then run `format` script

## Future updates

* Add compilling to one file (or at least not that many) with webpack/esbuild
* FIXME in `app.js`
* Have even more funny sounds engaged
